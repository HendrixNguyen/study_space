Martin Garrix can certainly be counted as one of them. Currently being 18 years old, he is recognized as one of the most talented guys out there. He just landed his first record deal and has already been spotted in de studio with Sidney Samson and that other Dutch mega talent Julian Jordan. His first official release 'Keygen' received great DJ support and ranked high in the Beatport charts and his remix of Roy Gates' 'Midnight Sun' flew up Beatport's Progressive House chart. In the DJ department Martin is quite the busy one too. He's had gigs at Mysteryland and was the youngest DJ ever to play the world's largest nightclub Privilege in Ibiza. He's a regular guest at LMFAO's 'Dont Let Daddy Know' parties and Redfoo's 'Sorry For Party Rocking' club nights, where he shared the booth with Sidney Samson, Eva Simmons, Diplo and many more. Martin Garrix is very well on the way to becoming hot EDM property, so keep your eyes and ears peeled!","strBiographyDE":null,"strBiographyFR":"Martin Garrix, de son vrai nom Martijn Garritsen, n\u00e9 le 14 mai 1996 \u00e0 Amstelveen, est un disc jockey, compositeur et producteur musical n\u00e9erlandais.
